        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Why we are here:</h2>
        <p>
            The Backyard Barbarian is a hobby shop where we provide the gaming community a sanctuary to &ldquo;nerd
            out&rdquo; and use our base as a &ldquo;home&rdquo; away from home. We do this by hosting many social
            events such as
            card game tournaments, miniature paint night, D&amp;D Adventurer's leagues and many more. We believe that
            these events bring people together and build a close-knit community by giving everyone the chance to
            make new friends, find a new hobby, try something new, or even just a place to hang out and relax. Making
            sure that everyone is having a good time is our #1 priority.
        </p>
        <h2>Where we began:</h2>
        <p>
            The Backyard Barbarian was founded by Byron Stuike and Crystal Rapchuk as of Oct 1, 2018. Byron and Crystal
            are avid gamers and have played many different types of games and RPG&rsquo;s for the past 20+ years.
            The decision to create The Backyard Barbarian came from their keen interest and passion for games, and
            enjoying this passion with friends, family, and even aquantinces. They want to build a community since
            it is quite spread out in the city with only a few stores dedicated to this comunities&rsquo; interests.
            They decided that to bring this community closer was to open at a location where it is easy for gamers of
            all ages to get together easily. All the hard work would have not come to fruition if it wasn&rsquo;t for
            the support of family and friends.
        </p>
        <h2>Where we are going:</h2>
        <p>
            We want to expand our product selection and services to cater to a wide range of tastes. With a bright
            outlook in 2019 we will begin to start looking at midnight releases and promos for specific genre of games
            like Magic the Gathering, so be sure to keep an eye on our announcements or subscribe to our email.
