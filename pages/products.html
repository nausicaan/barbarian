        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>
            Magic the Gathering is a popular trading card game that has been around for 25 years and is still going
            strong. Whether you are new to trading card games or a veteran, Magic the Gathering has something
            for everybody. We have custom built decks that you can buy, or you can even test one for free in the shop
            against other players to help you get started, so you can enjoy the thrill of a wizard&rsquo;s duel.
            Magic the Gathering is a great way to get you out of your comfort zone and make new friends as we have
            players of all ages and different skill levels. We are happy to have you join this wonderful game and will
            answer any question you may have. We also host every Friday Night a Magic Gathering draft tournament from
            6:00pm - 10:00pm for only $5.00, this includes the chance to win Magic the Gathering card prize packs.
            If you would like to know more information on Magic the Gathering be sure to check out the official

        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>
            If you have never played Dungeons and Dragons and have always wanted to, then The D&amp;D Adventurers
            League is for you. The D&amp;D Adventurers League uses the fifth edition Dungeons and Dragons rules,
            and players will use these rules to create a character that they can bring to any D&amp;D Adventurers
            League game anywhere it is supported. The D&amp;D Adventurers League is featured in the Forgotten Realms
            setting
            and is an ongoing official campaign. We play every Tuesday and Thursday from 5:00pm - 9:00pm, and all you
            need is your character sheet, dice, pen/pencil, and something to write on. if you would like to join
            and have not made a character yet, or you are unsure on how to make one, then no worries! We will help you
            before the game starts. Be sure to check out the official Wizards of the Coast
            <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/playevents/organized-play" target="_blank">D&amp;D Adventurers League site</a>
            for more information or additional resources. Keep in mind you dont have to be a player, you can even
            be the Dungeon Master (DM) as well.
