        <h3>Cluedo gets Game of Thrones makeover</h3>
        <p>Game of Thrones season six brutally killed off 34 major characters with the finale spelling the end for
            Margaery Tyrell, Tommen Baratheon and the High Sparrow
            in the first 20 minutes alone. So what better board game to get a Westeros makeover than Cluedo? The hugely
            popular crime mystery sees players race to determine
            who murdered the victim, with which weapon, in which room of a mansion. Cluedo: Game of Thrones arrives in
            the UK in October, featuring a double-sided board. One
            side is set in Meereen and the other in the Red Keep, with nine ‘rooms’ for each from the Temple of the
            Graces and the Dragon Catacombs to Cersei’s Bedchambers and,
            of course, the Throne Room. There will be twelve suspects, six in each setting: Daenerys Targaryen, Jorah
            Mormont, Grey Worm, Missandei, Daario Naharis and Hizdahr
            Zo Loraq in Meereen and Sansa Stark, Jamie Lannister, Margaery Tyrell, Tyrion Lannister, Cersei Lannister
            and Petyr Baelish in the Red Keep. There will be six weapons
            - the Crossbow, Poison Vial, Battle Axe, Catspaw Assassin Dagger, Arakh and Faceless Man - and 21 ‘intrigue
            cards’ featuring Master of Whisperers and White Walkers.
            The game will cost £29.99 and be available from the HBO EU shop from next month. Last year, a Thrones
            version of board game classic Monopoly was released just in
            time for Christmas, featuring locations such as King’s Landing, Winterfell and Castle Black. Train stations
            in the original are replaced with families and
            bannerman, while green houses are villages and red hotels are keep. Players can choose between a white
            walker, direwolf, three-eyed raven, dragon egg, crown
            and the Iron Throne as pieces, with the aim of the game being to buy, trade and sell to gain power, wealth
            and control. Game of Thrones returns for its
            reportedly penultimate seventh season next spring. Meanwhile, fans are awaiting George RR Martin’s next A
            Song of Ice and Fire instalment, The Winds of Winter,
            but are yet to receive a confirmed release date amid a relentless spate of rumours.</p>
